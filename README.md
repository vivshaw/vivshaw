A refresh of my website, https://vivshaw.net.

This site is built on React and Gatsby, and hosted on Netlify.

Gotta love the JAMStack.ðŸ¦„

## FIXMEs

- Type the frontmatter so it won't break when here are optional fields
- TypeScriptify the remainder of everything
- Consolidate into standard JS directories
- Netlify deployment
- Fit frontpage on one screen

## Next Steps

- CI/CD
- Redesign
- TailwindCSS
- Storybook
- Generate post and project templates
- react-helmet-async?
