{{ page.excerpt }}

[tweeter-robo](https://github.com/vivshaw/tweeter-robo) was born from curiosity. I've always found the idea of [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art) fascinating, and I've been amazed at the [sometimes thought-provoking](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/twitter-bot-predicts-these-futures), [sometimes hilarious](http://barrl.net/2748) artistic projects I've seen Twitter used for. As a platform, Twitter makes it trivially easy to disseminate your work, and gives immediacy and interactivity through social sharing. So, when I saw how easy it was to use Twitter with [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/), I gave it a try with my own literary Twitter bot, and [blogged about the process](https://vivshaw.github.io/vivshaw-next/blog/build-you-a-tweetbot-1/) so that other Pythonistas can learn along with me. The bot uses Tweepy and [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify), and is designed to be deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com). The code is, of course, all [on my GitHub](https://github.com/vivshaw/tweeter-robo). If you want to see it in action, check out [@MechaBronte](https://twitter.com/MechaBronte), my Twitter bot trained on Charlotte BrontÃ«'s *Jane Eyre*.
