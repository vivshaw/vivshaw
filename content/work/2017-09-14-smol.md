[smol](https://smol.space/) is my Rails learning app. As you can see, it's still very much an obvious work in progress, but it's getting there! As I've been learning more, I've been gradually building out features. At the moment, I'm working on OpenAuth with Devise & Omniauth, and testing with Rspec and Factory_Girl. Why, you might ask, am I exploring Rails in 2017? Partially because I wanted to familiarize myself more with the classic server-based CRUD app way of doing things... but, let's be honest, largely because Ruby and Rails are both so delightfully developer-friendly & easy to play with. The code is, of course, all [on my GitHub](https://github.com/vivshaw/smol-v1).
